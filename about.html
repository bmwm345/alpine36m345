      Optioned by Sandy Sansing BMW of Penascola. The Style 39 wheels pull the sedan’s profile together and complements the body lines well. 
      
      The real significance is that this was the first M3 to offer four doors. It proved that a practical sedan could still have the heart of a driver’s car and its younger siblings of the ///M lineup follow the same philosophy, even to this day.

Born on the 17th of September in 1997 in the BMW factory of Greer, South Carolina, this fine example of an E36M3 didn't stay at the factory for long. As one of the last E36 M3 Sedans ever made, it was loaded onto a truck and hauled down to Sandy Sansing BMW in Pensacola, Florida. There, a prosperous banker signed the papers and took it on its maiden voyage. For the next 40,000 miles, 
ALPINE36M spent the first decade living the easy life in the Florida sun—no salt, no snow. Eventually, in the early 2000s, it left its home and located north to Illinois, 
surviving the Midwest winters until 2016, when it finally headed west to Washington. In 2025, we became the next chapter of this E36's story.`;
